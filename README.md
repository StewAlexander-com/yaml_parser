# yaml_parser

```This python 3 program creates a list of keys from a ingested yaml file,
and then prints the keys in the list in a new file called "keys.txt"
Then one can ask for the value of a key by typing the key name in the terminal, which it also
saves in a yaml file called "outputs.yaml
```

* This code requires pyyaml, to install install it via "```pip install pyyaml```"
